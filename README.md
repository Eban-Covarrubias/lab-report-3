### researching find command:
The first option that I looked into using with the find command was the -name option. This allows you to easily find
file paths to files that you are uncertain to which directories they are inside of, and also for finding every file that 
matches a certain pattern.

Here you can see that I used the find command with the -name option to find the path to the txt file rr74.txt. Using this 
option we can find the path without knowing which specific directory the file is in, so long as we know a directory that is
containing some path to a file with that name the find command will search every possible path for it.
